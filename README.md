# Neural Network learns to cure COVID-19!

This isn't actually anything real, it's simply an april fools joke.

## Problem Statement: 

People are overly-concerned about american rights, and, as a result, they disobey suggestions given by the government and have large gatherings. Here is a fine example:

To prevent such things, we must teach our neural network to stay at home

### INPUT:

Whether we are at home or not
| state | location |
|---|--------|
| 0 | at home|
| 1 | outside|

### OUTPUT:

Should we go out or not?
| output | go out? |
|---|--------|
| 0 | no |
| 1 | yes|

Since we're living in 2020, and everything is about neural networks, we HAVE to use a neural network, regarless of whether the program can be written in one line of code or not:

Lame, boring and not 2020-esque answer:

```python
print(1)
```
So, we can use genetic algorithms and neural networks to evolve a neural network with one input neuron, one output neuron and no hidden layers.

After 1 generation, the neural network succesfully completed the task!

## Running the Program

Run the program with

```bash
python3 test.py
```
## Requirements

* Python3
* Install dependencies with

```bash 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
